During the sabbatical I'll have reduced expenses of about $3000 per month since I won't be commuting or buying work clothes. But I want to take a big trip in August that'll cost around $4500. I'm also getting a sabbatical bonus of $3000 in June before I leave. Currently have $8000 saved. Planning timeline: June 2024 through October 2024.",
