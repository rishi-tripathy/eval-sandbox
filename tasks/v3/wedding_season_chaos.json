  "prompt": "So I make about $4200 monthly and usually spend around $3500 on everything. The thing is, my best friend's getting married in June and I'm in the wedding party - that's going to be like $2000 for the dress, bachelorette, gifts, everything. Then my cousin's wedding is in August, probably another $1500 for that whole thing. Oh and somewhere in there I need to get my car fixed - the mechanic said probably $2500 but I can probably put that off until July if needed. Starting May 2024 with $4000 saved up, want to see how this plays out through October.",
