My monthly take-home is $3900 and I spend roughly $3200 on the usual stuff. I should probably get the equipment next month, but might wait until the month after if money's tight. Also getting a work-from-home stipend of $500 starting when I begin remote work, which is next month. Begin planning from January 2024 with $1200 in savings for a 4-month period.",
